Unreal Exporter

Setup :

Download exclusively the pithon file (.py), or extract it from the zip, then install it with the classic way : (edit; preference; addon; install; select the file; enable the addon)

Fonctions : 

This addon will export separately all your selected meshes at the world origin, based on their own origins. Typically if you want to import on unreal with a quick drag and drop, you will have the right origins for each objects, and they will keep it at each reimport (if you exported with the addon)
basics :

----------------------------------------------

set a path : 
	In the 3d viewport, open the tool menu (N) , go to tool, and set a path of an existing folder (create the folder before using the script, if not, it will not work), you dont need to transform it (you can keep spacebar, …).
 
Export :
	You have 2 ways to export with this add-on, using huge button export under the panel, or in the export classic panel. Plus, you can add a shortcut to it by right clicking on it and “assign shortcut”.
